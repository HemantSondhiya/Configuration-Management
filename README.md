# 🛠️ Spring Boot Configuration Management with Spring Cloud Config Server & RabbitMQ

This project demonstrates **centralized configuration management** for multiple **Spring Boot microservices** using **Spring Cloud Config Server** and **RabbitMQ** for **dynamic property refresh**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Managing configuration across multiple environments and microservices can be complex.  
Spring Cloud Config Server allows you to **store configuration files in a GitHub repository** and serve them to all your Spring Boot clients.  
With **Spring Cloud Bus + RabbitMQ**, configuration updates can be **broadcast dynamically** to all services without restarting them.
